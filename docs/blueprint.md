- Accent color: Pale yellow (#F4D35E) to highlight interactive elements and call to action, ensuring visual contrast.
- Font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif for clear UI and easy-to-read game information. Using PT Sans for headlines and body text. 
- Use strawberry-themed icons and elements to visually represent each stage of production.
- Center the game elements on the screen for easy access and focus. Ensure all key information is visible and accessible.
- Provide subtle visual cues and animations (like a scaling animation on the main 'strawberry' element) when clicking. Also use subtle transitions for game progression, such as stage advancements or when new stock becomes available
